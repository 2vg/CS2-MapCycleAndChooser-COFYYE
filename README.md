# MapCycleAndChooser

MapCycleAndChooser is a CS2 plugin designed to give server admins complete control over map rotations and player interactions. With this plugin, you can manage map cycles, enable map voting, and customize various settings to optimize gameplay for all players.

## Features

- **Next Map Configuration & Display**: Set the next map in the cycle and display it for players.
- **Map Voting**: Players can vote for a new map towards the end of the current map.
- **Real-time Voting Percentages**: View the percentage of votes for each map in real time.
- **Admin Map List**: Admins can access a list of available maps and instantly change the current map.
- **Dynamic Map Cycle**: Set which maps are part of the cycle and which ones can be changed from the map list.
- **Dynamic Map Selection**: Maps are selected based on the current number of players, with options for max and min player thresholds.
- **Custom Map Display**: Show custom names instead of map values (e.g., showing "Dust II" instead of "de_dust2").
- **Round/Timelimit-Based Map Changes**: Change maps based on the number of rounds or time limits.
- **Vote Start Sound**: Play a sound when the voting for a new map begins.

### General Settings

1. **`vote_map_enable`**  
   - **Possible Values**: `true`, `false`  
   - **Description**: Enables or disables the voting system for a new map.  
     - `true`: Voting is enabled.  
     - `false`: Voting is disabled.

2. **`vote_map_duration`**  
   - **Possible Values**: Integer values (e.g., `30`, `60`, etc.)  
   - **Description**: Specifies the duration (in seconds) for the map voting period.

3. **`vote_map_on_freezetime`**  
   - **Possible Values**: `true`, `false`  
   - **Description**: Controls whether voting starts during freeze time.  
     - `true`: Increases the freeze time in the next round and starts voting during it.  
     - `false`: Voting starts at the beginning of the next round but does not extend freeze time. Players can vote while the round progresses.

4. **`depends_on_the_round`**  
   - **Possible Values**: `true`, `false`  
   - **Description**: Determines whether map voting is based on rounds or time.
